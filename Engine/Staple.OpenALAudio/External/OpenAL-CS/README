About the C# Wrapper
--------------------
The C# wrapper was written to be used for FNA's audio support. However, this
is written in a way that can be used for any general C# application.

OpenAL# is a pure port of the C headers. The naming schemes for this library
will be exactly as they are done in the C library, with little-to-no concern
for "appropriate" C# style. The namespace indicates that this is OpenAL, the
class names will indicate which OpenAL standard version the
function/type/value exists in, and everything else will be as close to the C
version as technically possible.

Also note that we do not use alGetProcAddress to obtain extension functions.
Since this wrapper specifically supports OpenAL Soft only, we will be
accessing the library's entry points directly.
